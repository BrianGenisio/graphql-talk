# Markdown KA presentation framework

I got tired of making presentations in google docs, so I started making them in
markdown instead!

Originally built in webpackbin, then exported and modified to this.

## Start

`npm install`

`npm start`

Go to `localhost:3001`

Edit the presentation in [src/preso.html](src/preso.html).
