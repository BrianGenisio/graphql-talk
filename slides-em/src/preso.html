# Why do we open source?
~~~
Open source

1. makes us think about our API boundaries
2. lets us get feedback from the community
3. shows off the engineering work that KA does
~~~
### API boundaries

* Design for users
* For libraries, other devs are users
* Build to make the code easy to use
~~~
### Community engagement

* Solves unique problems for other developers
* A way for the community to contribute to KA
~~~
### Shows KA Engineering

* Helps people believe in our company
* Helps recruiting
* Lets devs show off their work!
